\section{\textbf{Executive summary (summary or abstract)}}
This report discusses the major challenges or hindrances as to why the music industry of Uganda has failed to become one of the famous leading music industries across different parts of the world.
The information presented in this report has been gathered according to the chronological previous musical events in Uganda.
The report has been prepared as an assessable component and an assignment for the research methodology course.
\section{\textbf{Introduction}} 
Music in Uganda has been focused on different genres of music such as ragga, reggae, RnB and Hip hop with a dramatic increase in the number of male musicians, producers and promoters than the females. Most musicians are based in the central parts of Uganda.
The purpose of this report is to outline the factors or issues prohibiting or exempting Uganda’s music Industry from excelling through different parts of the world and overwhelmingly being appreciated through receiving accolades or awards by recognized award organizations for example Grammy awards.
\section{\textbf{Results}}
1.	Uganda’s production of music.
Generally music production over the recent years up-to-date has been of less quality as compared to western music due to having a limited number of experienced and high skilled producers thus delivering semi music production for the audience’s listening pleasure.



2.	Distribution and promotion of music.
Most of the music platforms in Uganda for example Urban and the national television(NTV)  have deviated and resorted to playing Nigerian,Jamaican and most of the music from international countries thus having little air play for local music which narrows down the fan base that can buy their album copies.



3.	The rate of investment in music 
 A high number of the musicians lack sponsorship by the capable music labels to boost their music careers outside Uganda. The musicians also have tendencies of releasing low budget videos with low quality which is welcomed with little attention or caution to be played on international channels or platforms for example Trace Urban which reduces their awareness by people in outside countries.



4.	Management of music 
Most of the musicians in Uganda have been with poor management that hardly fails to organize international gigs, concerts, shows, tours and album launches outside Uganda to gradually increase on their fan base worldwide.
\section{\textbf{Conclusion}}
Overall, the highest percentage of musicians in Uganda have their target audiences in the central regions which has limited their fan base worldwide.
\section{\textbf{Recommendation}}
There should be an advancement in both the audio and video production equipment and the required corporations between the promoters and distributers of local music outside Uganda.
